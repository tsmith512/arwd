  Yeoman generates all your sub-theme files, including <code>.info</code>
  and <code>template.php</code>. It also includes a Gemfile, Sass files, and
  optionally Gulp, Grunt or Bower files.

<p class="small">Currently, the generator creates sub-themes for Aurora and Zen,
  but the project is growing. <br />For more info, check out the repository on
