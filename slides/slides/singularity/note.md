# SPECIAL NOTICE:

<p class="large">
  We are using Singularity v1.2.0+, <br />
  which has a different syntax than previous versions. <br /><br />

  <small>
    If you are using an older version on a project, see
    [the wiki](https://github.com/at-import/Singularity/wiki/)
    for the older syntax.

<aside class="notes">
  I was unable to find the old syntax documentation, but left the link in place.
