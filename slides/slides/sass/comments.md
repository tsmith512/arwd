## Comments

<pre><code class="language-scss">/*
 * Standard / multi-line comments will appear in your final CSS file!
 * Use these comments to mark major sections or separate partials.
 */

// Double-slash / single-line comments <em>WON'T</em> appear in your final CSS!
// Use these comments for developer notes.</code></pre>

<p class="small">At <span class="fourkitchens">Four Kitchens</span>, we add a
  multi-line comment at the top of each partial. This will help with debugging
  because we will always know what partial we are looking at. When CSS is later
  minified, these will get stripped out, too.</p>
